# Iris Dataset Visualization

This project provides an extensive visualization of the well-known Iris dataset using Python's prominent libraries, Plotly and Matplotlib.

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most popular ones for getting started with data visualization and machine learning. It contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

This project, using Python, effectively loads the Iris dataset from the scikit-learn package, processes the data into a manageable structure with the help of pandas, and then generates comprehensive and interactive visualizations. Two distinct types of scatter plots are created. The first one demonstrates the correlation between sepal length and width, crafted using Plotly Express. The second scatter plot, made via Matplotlib, illustrates the correlation between petal length and width.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- [Plotly Express](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)
- [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
